# Project README


### Usage

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebook/` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to replicate our experiments.

## Getting Started

To run the experiments and see the results, start with the `notebook/` directory:

- `consignes.ipynb`: Guidelines and initial setup instructions.
- `experiments_script.ipynb`: To perform and visualize the experiments on the RBM,DBN and RBM models.
- `experiments_ALPHA_DIGITS.ipynb`: For deeper dive into the Alpha Digits dataset experiments
- `experiments_application.ipynb`: For deeper dive into the MNIST dataset experiments


### Archive Content

The project archive includes:

- **src/ :** Contains the source code for our implementation of the RBM, DBM and DNN.
- **data/ :** Sample datasets used for training and testing.
- **notebooks/ :** Notebooks outputing the results.


### See the other Branch 'Bonus' of this git for reconstruction analysis based on VAE, GAN, CapsuleNet
